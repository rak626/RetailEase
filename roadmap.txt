This database structure provides a foundation for your billing and payment software. It allows you to track customer information, store details, product data, transactions, and invoices. You can expand and optimize this structure based on specific requirements, such as supporting multiple mall locations, multiple payment methods, tax calculations, and more advanced features.

Ensure that you establish proper indexing, relationships, and constraints within the database to maintain data integrity and optimize query performance. Additionally, consider implementing data encryption and access controls to enhance security, especially for sensitive data like customer information and financial records.
